What we do suggest however that you pick a use case that is a material and challenging use case for you so you are able to get a good idea of the results. 
Do you have such a use case already identified?",0,9,8,Salesperson 1 provides more specific information on a phased approach
Is there any room for negotiation on the support costs?,"""I understand your concern about the support costs. While our support is comprehensive, we could look at tailoring it more specifically to your needs. For instance, we could reduce the cost by adjusting the support hours or response times. Alternatively, if you have a strong internal IT team, we could explore a co-support model. What aspects of the support package are most valuable to you?""","I understand your concern about the support costs. While our support is comprehensive, we could look at tailoring it more specifically to your needs. For instance, we could reduce the cost by adjusting the support hours or response times. Alternatively, if you have a strong internal IT team, we could explore a co-support model. One other option available to you is a discount if you were to commit to a longer term contract.
What aspects of the support package are most valuable to you?",1,9,9,Both offer similar levels of flexibility on support costs
Can you include additional training or consulting hours in the package without increasing the price?,"""I appreciate you asking about this. While our proposed package already includes substantial training, I understand the value of additional support. I can offer an additional 20 hours of consulting time at no extra cost. This could be used for advanced training, workflow optimization, or custom report development. Would this added value address your concerns?""","I appreciate you asking about this. Our goal is to ensure you gain adoption and value from the platform within your organzation. What we have done with other customers is offered additional training linked to adoption goals within their organization. 
Is that something you are willing to consider?",1,9,8,Salesperson 1 offers a specific number of additional hours
What guarantees can you offer on the implementation timeline?,"""We're confident in our 4-month implementation estimate, but I understand the importance of timely delivery. We can add a clause to our contract that provides a service credit if we exceed the agreed-upon timeline. For instance, we could offer a 5% credit for each week of delay, up to a maximum of 20%. Would this type of guarantee give you the assurance you're looking for?""","Our implementation resources are available on a T&M basis. There are many dependencies on the implementation timeline including availability of your resources and integration with your internal systems. While we have done many such integrations offer, it is hard for us to offer guarantees in this area since we do not control availability of resources to guide these decisions. ",0,9,7,Salesperson 1 offers specific guarantees while 2 explains limitations
"If we commit to becoming a reference customer, can you offer any additional incentives?","""We greatly value reference customers and would be delighted to have you as one. In exchange for agreeing to be a reference (including potential case studies and peer recommendations), we can offer an additional 5% discount on your annual license fee. We would also prioritize your feature requests in our product roadmap. How does this sound to you?""",I would be happy to discuss that. We have offered some incentives to customers who agreed to becoming lighthouse customers for us and agreed to produce case studies and participate in joint speaking sessions. Is that something you are willing to consider?,1,9,8,Salesperson 1 offers more specific incentives for being a reference customer
Can we include a performance-based pricing component?,"""That's an interesting proposal. We're open to exploring a performance-based pricing model. We could structure it so that a portion of your fee is tied to agreed-upon KPIs","We have a consumption based pricing model, based on the modules you choose and the volume of data processed. We will be providing you a dashboard so you can get a daily view of the costs incurred. 
On the performance, we will work with you to fine tune the data models or the underlying infrastructure if performance is not performing for any reason. Our goal is to have a long term relationship, and we want to make sure you are a happy and satisfied customer. ",0,8,7,Salesperson 1 is more open to performance-based pricing
"The incumbent provider just offered us a 25% discount so we stay on their platform, and now your pricing is much higher than theirs. Can you match their pricing so we can reconsider you?","I understand the appeal of a 25% discount from your current provider. While we may not be able to directly match that price, I'm confident our solution offers superior value that more than justifies the cost difference. Our advanced features like AI-driven analytics and real-time fraud detection often lead to cost savings and revenue increases that far exceed the price gap.
Would you be open to a detailed ROI analysis comparing our solution to your discounted current system? We could also explore performance-based pricing to align our fees with the value we deliver. Our goal is to be a long-term partner in driving your business success, not just a low-cost provider.","Looks like we are already delivering value for you! I am definitely willing to go back to my executives to see if there are any reductions possible but I wanted you to consider a few things. 1. our customers choose us because of the the advanced analytics, precision of the AI models, and the configrability of the platform. Those were some of the things you had cited were missing from the incumbent provider and reasons for the migration. 2. we offer very transparent pricing which has allowed us to scale quickly across many customers. Offering bait and switch pricing techniques erode customer trust and slow us down in terms of pricing. 
What I have seen work in terms of a discount is when are customers are willing to do a longer term contract or agree to be a reference customer. Are you willing to consider those?",0,8,10,Salesperson 2 provides a more strategic and value-focused response
