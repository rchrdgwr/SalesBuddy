**Analysis Results**

**Summary:** The opportunity with HSBC involves offering a new analytics engine for their loan origination system, which is currently slow and inflexible. The urgency for decision-making stems from their upcoming renewal with the existing vendor. Multiple meetings have taken place, including an initial discovery call, a technical deep dive, and a proposal review, with HSBC expressing interest in moving forward. The next step involves further discussions with John Smith, the VP of Information Technology, to potentially proceed to a pilot program or final negotiations.
