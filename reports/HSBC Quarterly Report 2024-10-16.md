### HSBC Quarterly Report - Q3 2024

#### Overview
HSBC Holdings plc, one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, has been navigating a transformative period marked by strategic shifts, leadership changes, and a focus on digital innovation. As of October 2024, the bank is actively pursuing cost-cutting measures, expanding its wealth management services, and launching new ventures in embedded finance.

#### Key Developments
1. **Cost-Cutting Initiatives**: HSBC is reportedly considering a cost-cutting plan aimed at saving up to $300 million, primarily targeting senior management positions. This move is part of a broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and respond to changing market conditions ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hsbc-mulls-cost-cutting-plan-save-up-300-mln-ft-reports-2024-10-10/)).

2. **Leadership Changes**: The bank has seen significant leadership transitions, with Noel Quinn announcing his retirement as Group Chief Executive after nearly five years. Georges Elhedery has been appointed as his successor, tasked with leading HSBC through its next phase of development ([HSBC News](https://www.hsbc.com/news-and-views/news)).

3. **Expansion of Wealth Management**: HSBC aims to double its assets under management in the UK wealth business to Â£100 billion ($131 billion) over the next five years. This initiative is part of a strategy to target the 'mass affluent' market, which is increasingly becoming a focus for major banks ([Financial Express](https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade-market/hsbc-looks-to-double-uk-wealth-business-as-banks-target-mass-affluent-1724516994)).

4. **Launch of Embedded Finance Venture**: In October 2024, HSBC launched a joint venture called SemFi with Tradeshift, aimed at providing embedded finance solutions to business clients. This venture will initially operate in the UK and is designed to integrate HSBC's financial services into e-commerce platforms, enhancing accessibility for SMEs ([Finextra](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/44827/hsbc-launches-embedded-finance-venture)).

5. **Market Outlook and Economic Implications**: As the US elections approach, HSBC's market insights suggest that while election outcomes may introduce volatility, historical trends indicate that US equity markets tend to perform positively in the six months following elections, regardless of the political party in power ([HSBC UK](https://www.hsbc.co.uk/wealth/insights/market-outlook/special-coverage/2024-10-14/)).

6. **Write-Offs and Strategic Divestments**: HSBC has also been restructuring its portfolio, including writing off its remaining $5.8 million stake in UK fintech Monese and considering the sale of its South African business to focus on more lucrative markets ([FinTech Futures](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/10/hsbc-reportedly-writes-off-remaining-5-8m-stake-in-uk-fintech-monese/), [FinTech Futures](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/08/hsbc-reportedly-considering-sale-of-its-south-african-business/)).

#### Conclusion
HSBC is positioning itself for future growth through strategic cost management, leadership renewal, and a focus on digital transformation. The bank's initiatives in wealth management and embedded finance reflect its commitment to adapting to the evolving financial landscape while maintaining a strong operational foundation. As it navigates these changes, HSBC remains focused on delivering value to its shareholders and clients alike.
